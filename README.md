# Stock_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

We built a workbook for steve already but now we have to do a little more research for his parents. Our job is to expand the dataset to include entire stock market over the last few years. We have built a faster code that can run the entire stock dataset in about 0.125 seconds which helps us and is convenient for both us and the readers.

## Results
